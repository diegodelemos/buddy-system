# Buddy system

## Goal
The goal of the buddy system is multifaceted:
* Ensure newcomers feel comfortable and part of our team.
* Speed up the process of gaining essential technical knowledge for working on Invenio.
* Develop buddies skills in communication and take larger responsibility in the project.

## Buddy duties
A ‘buddy’ is a person, who is assigned to a newcomer for the first two months to help the person whenever the person will need it. The selected buddy should normally be a person from another service team to ensure cross-team integration in the section, however in particular the buddy should not be the newcomer’s supervisor. The section leader is responsible for assigning the buddy to the newcomer. Also, the buddy must be available during the first two weeks after thenewcomer arrives, and should not have extended absences (i.e. >2-3 weeks) during the first two months.

For absences of a week or more, the buddy should ensure to hand-over buddy responsibilities to a colleague.

Responsibilities of a buddy:
* Prior to arrival:
    * Buddy must meet the newcomer’s supervisor in order to get an overview of newcomer’s project and discuss the first couple of tasks with the supervisor:
        * Arrange time for when the supervisor will introduce the buddy on first day (and ensure the buddy is not on vacation during the first 2 weeks when the newcomer arrives).
        * Find two tasks in Invenio: one small (~1 hr) and one medium sized (~1 day) suitable for pair-programming.
        * Find a first larger service task that supervisor will help
    * Buddy must prepare for running the bootcamp of the new arrival (i.e. read up relevant Invenio documentation, rehearse the presentations, test tutorials, check if any part of the material is outdated).
* After arrival:
    * First day:
        * Take a coffee, present yourself and your project. Possibly talk about:
        * CERN structure: what is department, section, group
        * EDH and absences
        * Let him/her ask about doubts about the project.
    * 1st week:
        * Bootcamp: Run the bootcamp with the newcomer (using standard material/presentations):
        * Presentation: Introduction to Invenio, use-cases and digital repositories.
        * Presentation: Communication channels: Gitter, Mattermost.Maintainers, Meetings
        * Guided tutorial: Get Invenio up and running.
        * Guided tutorial: Setting up your development environment
        * Guided tutorial: Developing for Invenio, including cookiecutter (+seeing all the files), tiny task, running tests, installing inside invenio
        * Pair-programming: Solve first small task.
        * Tutorial: Submitting a pull request
        * Presentation: Overview of contribution and style guide
        * Pair-programming: Solve medium sized task.
        * Presentation: Invenio general architecture overview. Module overview.
        * Remember: newcomer also needs “free” time for setting up their OS, office space etc.
    * Bring newcomer to:
        * First coming Friday section coffee
        * Lunches
        * First coming Invenio Developer Forum.
        * Encourage newcomer to take part in the evenings events (if there’s som).
    * Arrange with newcomer to meet for a daily coffee in social room during second week.
    * Arrange for pair-programming on service task.
    * Ask for feedback on bootcamp week.
* 2nd week:
    * Pair-programming on service task.
    * Every day, take a coffee in e.g. social room 1-to-1. Use the daily coffee to:
        * Proactively ask if she/he is having any doubts, questions or is confused.
        * Be interested how are you doing as a buddy.
* 3rd-8th week:
    * Be accessible for newcomer to all questions.
    * Look after newcomer and check that pull request and interaction with the section is appropriate (i.e. according to CERN and Invenio code of conduct).
    * Continue bringing newcomer Friday coffees.
    * Minimum once a week, take a 1-to-1 coffee in social room:
        * Before the coffee (and preferably continuously during the week), check the newcomer’s pull requests and check if other colleagues comments are appropriate. Use this information to:
        * Proactively ask for feedback:
        * Newcomer feel comfortable making pull requests, or how newcomer felt about a specific comment.
        * E.g. if the buddy can do a better in terms of availability.
        * If he/she feels comfortable with interrupting the buddy.
* 8th week:
    * Feedback session on first two months: what was good, what was bad, what could be improved.

## Good behavioural practices
Apart from above responsibilities, the buddy is also supposed to keep in mind a list of a good
behavioural practices that he/she should take.
* Technical
    * Make a newcomer comfortable of making mistakes
        * Don’t let one be afraid of writing not fully correct issue or having comments on PR
        * Make sure that the amount of comments under first github action is reasonable
    * Remember not everyone has used git before or feel comfortable with it, so if needed, show basics
    * Constantly be interested how are you doing as a buddy.
    * Proactively ask for feedback about the system itself
        * In the end of the time period predicted, ask one what is the thing that one is missing, what one would change in the system

Moreover, the buddy should also remember about the social part of his/her job:
   * Social
    * Observe if a newcomer is not ashamed of asking consecutive question even if one is lost
    * Always be polite
    * Do not compare newcomer’s work and its duration to anyone else
