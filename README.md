# Buddy system

## Goal
The goal of the buddy system is multifaceted:

* Ensure newcomers feel comfortable and part of our team.
* Speed up the process of gaining essential technical knowledge for working on Invenio.
* Develop buddies skills in communication and take larger responsibility in the project.

## Who is involved?
As previously mentioned, the buddy system intends to improve the experience of newcomers, but for doing so there are three main actors who have to take part:

* The newcomer
* Newcomer's supervisor
* Buddy

It is important to keep in mind that the person who knows more about the newcomer's duties is his/her supervisor. Therefore, from now all the actions to be taken will come along with the actor who is in charge of performing them.

## Who is the Buddy?
* A person assigned to a newcomer for the first two months to help in both technical and social needs

* Someone from another service team to ensure cross-team integration in the section

* Can not be the newcomer’s supervisor

* The section leader is responsible of selecting the newcomer's buddy

* Should be available during the first two weeks after the newcomer arrives, and should not have extended absences (i.e. >2-3 weeks) during the first two months

* For absences of a week or more, the buddy should ensure to hand-over buddy responsibilities to a colleague

## What are the responsibilities?

Prior to arrival:

* Buddy must meet the newcomer’s supervisor in order to get an overview of newcomer’s project and discuss the first tasks:
    * Arrange time for when the supervisor will introduce the buddy on first day
    * Define tasks on Invenio:
        * One of the following small tasks: read up relevant Invenio documentation, rehearse the presentations, test tutorials, check if any part of the material is outdated (~1 hr)
        * A medium sized task (~1 day) suitable for pair-programming
        * A first larger service task in which the supervisor will help
* Buddy must prepare for running the bootcamp of the new arrival following `inveniosoftware/training` repository.

After arrival:

* First day:
    * Take a coffee, present yourself and your project. Possibly talk about:
	    * CERN structure: what is a department, section, group etc...
	    * EDH general features
	    * Let newcomer ask doubts about the project, the more the better

    * Bootcamp: Run the bootcamp with the newcomer (using standard material/presentations):
       * Presentation: Introduction to Invenio, use-cases and digital repositories
       * Presentation: Communication channels (Gitter, Mattermost etc...) Maintainers, Meetings
    * Guided tutorial: Setting up your development environment
    * Guided tutorial: Get Invenio up and running
    * Guided tutorial: Developing for Invenio, including cookiecutter (+seeing all the files), tiny task, running tests, installing inside Invenio
    * Pair-programming: Solve first small task
    * Tutorial: Submitting a pull request
    * Presentation: Overview of contribution and style guide
    * Pair-programming: Solve medium sized task
    * Presentation: Invenio general architecture overview

    * Arrange for pair-programming on a service task

* 2nd week:

	* Proactively ask for feedback
	* Newcomer should start to
