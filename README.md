# Buddy system

## Goal
The goal of the buddy system is multifaceted:

* Ensure newcomers feel comfortable and part of our team
* Speed up the process of gaining essential technical knowledge for working on Invenio
* Develop buddies skills in communication and take larger responsibility in the project

## Who is involved?
As previously mentioned, the buddy system intends to improve the experience of newcomers, but for doing so there are four main actors who have to take part:

* The newcomer
* Buddy
* Newcomer's supervisor
* Buddy system maintainer

## Who is the Buddy?
* A person assigned to a newcomer for the first two months to help in both technical and social aspects

* Someone from another service team to ensure cross-team integration inside the section

* Can not be the newcomer’s supervisor

* The section leader is responsible of selecting the newcomer's buddy

* Should be available during the first two weeks after the newcomer arrives, and should not have extended absences (i.e. >2-3 weeks) during the first two months

* For absences of a week or more, the buddy should ensure to hand-over buddy responsibilities to a colleague

## What are the responsibilities?

In general buddy's responsibilities are:
1. Being cool with newcomers :sunglasses:
2. Arrange informal meetings with her/him as often as needed
3. Follow up with the buddy system maintainer
4. Turn to the buddy system maintainer any time if needed

More specifically, since the process will span over a period of two months, the responsibilities will be divided by phase.

### Before newcomers arrival
The buddy must meet the newcomer’s supervisor in order to get an overview of her/his project and discuss the first tasks:

* Schedule when supervisor will introduce buddy to the newcomer
* Define tasks on Invenio
  * One of the following small tasks: read up relevant Invenio documentation, rehearse the presentations, test tutorials, check if any part of the material is outdated (~1 hr)
  * A medium sized task (~1 day) suitable for pair-programming
  * A first larger service task in which the supervisor will help
* Agree on who is going to run the bootcamp following `inveniosoftware/training` repository.

### First day

* Take a coffee, present yourself and your project. Possibly talk about:
  * CERN structure: what is a department, section, group etc...
  * EDH general features
  * Let newcomer ask doubts about anything, the more the better

* Make newcomer aware of:
	* Invenio Developer Forum
	* Friday section coffee
	* Our lunches together
	* Section events (if there are some coming)


### 1st week

* Run the bootcamp with the newcomer (using standard material/presentations) (if agreed with supervisor):
  * Presentation: Introduction to Invenio, use-cases and digital repositories
  * Presentation: Communication channels (Gitter, Mattermost etc...) Maintainers, Meetings
* Guided tutorial: Setting up your development environment
* Guided tutorial: Get Invenio up and running
* Guided tutorial: Developing for Invenio, including cookiecutter (+seeing all the files), tiny task, running tests, installing inside Invenio
* Pair-programming: Solve first small task
* Tutorial: Submitting a pull request
* Presentation: Overview of contribution and style guide
* Pair-programming: Solve medium sized task
* Presentation: Invenio general architecture overview
* Presentation: Module overview
* Plan for pair-programming on a service task

**Remember**, newcomers also need “free” time for setting up their environment, office space etc ...

### 2nd week

* Pair-programming on service task

### 3rd-8th week

* Try to have the newcomer feeling confortable so he will ask as much questions as needed
* Be accessible for newcomer
* Check that pull requests and interaction with the section is appropriate (i.e. according to CERN and Invenio code of conduct)
* Proactively ask for feedback

### 8th week

* Final feedback meeting with buddy (always take note about how to improve the system)
* Retrospective meeting about last two months with buddy system maintainer
